                <p>
                    The moment I entered the campus during Galian 2026, the mural was the first thing that caught my attention. 
                    Its vibrant colors and detailed artwork immediately stood out. The mural beautifully illustrates 
                    the college building together with elements of local culture, symbolizing identity, growth, and unity. 
                    It felt like a visual welcome — a proud representation of what CGCI stands for.

                <h2 class="script-title">Live Band Performances</h2>
                <p>
                    While we were waiting to be dismissed and preparing to go home, 
                    the sound of a live band started playing nearby. It wasn’t part of a formal program 
                    at that moment, but it made the waiting time more enjoyable. Instead of simply standing around, 
                    we listened to the music, talked with friends, and appreciated the lively atmosphere. 
                    The performance added a relaxed and memorable vibe to the end of the day.

                    I also had the chance to visit the BSCS Thesis Expo, which featured the official thesis projects 
                    of the 4th Year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science students. Each group presented 
                    systems and applications they developed as the culmination of their academic journey. 
                    One project that stood out was SalinKibo, which creatively used a teddy bear design 
                    to make assistive technology more engaging and approachable. It was inspiring to see 
                    how the graduating students transformed their knowledge and skills into innovative solutions.

                <h2 class="script-title">Cultural Dance Presentation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cultural Dance Presentation became one of the biggest highlights of Galian 2026. 
                    What made it even more special was that students from different courses participated, 
                    making it a true celebration of unity within the college. Each group performed with 
                    synchronized movements, traditional-inspired costumes, and expressive energy. 
                    Seeing every course come together on one stage made the presentation feel grand, meaningful, 
                    and unforgettable.
